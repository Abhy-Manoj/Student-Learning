Where cardholders are clustered into different groups based on their transaction amount. Then using sliding window strategy , to aggregate the transaction made by the cardholders from different groups so that the behavioural pattern of the groups can be extracted respectively. Later different classifiers  are trained over the groups separately. And then the classifier with better rating score can be chosen to be one of the best methods to predict frauds.

Gender relations within the family are likely to change in favour of greater sharing of domestic responsibilities between men and women. Older adults may particularly experience stress due to social distancing because of their physical dependency and emotional vulnerability. Working patterns are likely to become more flexible and promotive of social distancing. Human interaction based on digital technology is likely to increase.
